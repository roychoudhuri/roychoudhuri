Aws graduated with a master’s degree in Oncology from the University of Manchester. His MRes research project focused on the role of combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy for the treatment of solid tumours. He previously earned a bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Science at Keele University, where his final-year thesis focused on the role of pH in breast cancer.

Subsequently, he worked as a Research Assistant in Immunotherapy in Prof. Ahmed Ahmed’s lab at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM), University of Oxford, and was also part of the spin-out company Singula Bio Ltd. There, he worked on developing a novel type of neoantigen-specific tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for the treatment of solid tumours.

Aws joined the Roychoudhuri team as part of the MRes/PhD CRUK Cambridge Centre programme. He is interested in how different types of T cell responses are maintained in cancer.
