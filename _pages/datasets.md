<h3 style="margin-top:0px">GS-TCGA: Gene Set-based Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas</h3>
 
Most tools for analysing large gene expression datasets, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), focus on analysis of expression of individual genes or inference of the abundance of specific cell types from global gene expression data. While these methods provide useful
insights, they can overlook crucial process-based information that could enhance our understanding of cancer biology.
 
[**GS-TCGA**](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/) is a resource designed to enable novel biological insights through gene set-based analyses of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, leveraging gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). 
 
It consists of four tools:
 
[**Gene Set Survival Analysis:**](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/) GS-Surv allows the user to investigate how the average expression of genes in a specified gene set relates to overall survival in patient data.
 
[**Co-Correlative Gene Set Enrichment Analysis:**](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/) CC-GSEA allows generation of novel hypotheses of gene function through performing GSEA on co-correlated genes.
 
[**Gene Set Correlative Analysis:**](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/) GS-Corr calculates the average expression of a gene set and correlates this with individual genes.
 
[**GS-Surv (Custom):**](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/) This function allows you to upload your own gene set for GS-Surv survival analysis.
 
GS-TCGA was created by **Tarrion Baird** in our lab in 2023 and can be accessed at: [https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/](https://gs-tcga.shinyapps.io/home/)
