<h3 style="margin-top:0px">T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer</h3> 
The immune system has a **powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells**, but its function is often **suppressed within tumours**, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, **most patients do not durably respond** to today's immunotherapies.

Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses to evade destruction and resist immunotherapy. We aim to **translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies** for patients with cancer, combining mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel biologic, cellular and molecular therapies to **improve treatment** of advanced cancer patients or to **prevent cancer recurrence** in those at high risk of metastasis (see [Research](research)). 

Our laboratory is located at the [Department of Pathology](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/) and forms part of the [CRUK Cambridge Centre](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/).  The laboratory is led by [Rahul Roychoudhuri]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/member/rahul) who is Professor of Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy at the University of Cambridge.
