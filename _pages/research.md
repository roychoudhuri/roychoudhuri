<h3 style="margin-top:0px">T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer</h3> 
The immune system has a **powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells**, but its function is often **suppressed within tumors**, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including **checkpoint inhibitors** targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, **most patients still do not respond** to today's immunotherapies.

Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses to evade destruction and resist immunotherapy. We aim to **translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies** for patients with cancer. We combine mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel **biologic, cellular and small molecule therapies** to improve treatment of advanced cancer patients or to prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

### Suppression of T cell immunity within tumours
Tumors create **hostile chemical and cellular environments** that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We are interested in identifying and targeting mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells **release intracellular potassium** that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that **tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2**, enabling us to engineer **pH-selective IL-2 variant** with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

**Regulatory T (Treg) cells** suppress conventional T cell responses and are a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity (**Figure 1**). We are interested in understanding how Treg cells develop and function. We discovered that the **transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development** and established a widely-accepted molecular model for BACH2 function in lymphocytes (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). This work explained why genetic variations at the human *BACH2* locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of **BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA)**, a previously unrecognised human monogenic disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent **11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus** restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020).

Within tumors, we discovered that **activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells**, raising questions about how Treg populations are maintained within tumours (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified **CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells** and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now examining how therapeutic strategies could **reprogram Treg cells within tumors**, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

### T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Effective immune responses to cancer require **T cells to persist over long periods** while retaining their ability to kill tumor cells. We have studied the **molecular programs that control T cell longevity** and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now aim to translate into improved cell therapies for cancer patients (**Figure 2**).

<p style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 1.5em auto; font-style: italic;"><strong>Figure 2. Maintenance of acute and chronic T cell responses.</strong> In both acute and chronic immune responses, T cells undergo progressive differentiation accompanied by acquisition of effector functions and loss of maintenance potential self-renewal and multipotency. This loss of maintenance potential is a key feature of the progression of T cells from naive, effector, and memory T cell subsets in acute responses, as well as progenitor, intermediate, and terminally exhausted T cells in chronic responses.</p>

We conducted one of the earliest **multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses** of immune cells, revealing heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (Flatz, Roychoudhuri et al., PNAS 2011) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Roychoudhuri et al., Vaccine 2015). We discovered that **BACH2 functions as a regulator of T cell quiescence**, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). Mechanistically, **BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs** by occupying AP-1 binding sites and blocking access by AP-1 transcription factors. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains **NK cell maturation**, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We contributed to studies showing that **AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics** and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015), and that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (Gattinoni et al., J Clin Invest 2015).

We are now using these insights to engineer **improved CAR T cell therapies**. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with **enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function** for patients with advanced cancers.

### Immune Interception of Early Cancer and Cancer Metastasis
Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Yet early pre-malignant cancers and newly established or dormant micrometastases lack the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours (Fig. 3). This creates an opportunity for therapies that **utilize the immune system to prevent cancer** in high-risk individuals or **prevent recurrence** in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

<p style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 1.5em auto; font-style: italic;"><strong>Figure 3. Immune vulnerability of cancer cells at distinct stages of cancer development provides a potential window for immune prevention.</strong> Cancer progression through elimination, equilibrium, and escape phases results in the establishment of a protective immunosuppressive microenvironment, featuring regulatory T cells, MDSCs, TAMs, and suppressive factors that shield advanced tumours from immune attack. However, early-stage cancers and disseminated micrometastases lack this immunosuppressive armor, remaining vulnerable to elimination by T cells and NK cells. The immune vulnerability curve (bottom) reveals two critical therapeutic windows: early cancers before escape mechanisms develop, and micrometastatic deposits that are deprived of the protective tumour microenvironment. This vulnerability of early and disseminated disease represents a major opportunity for preventive immunotherapy—targeting cancer when it is most susceptible to immune elimination rather than after immunosuppressive defenses are established.</p>

We are interested in identifying mechanisms by which **metastatic sites become immunologically permissive** to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through **prolyl hydroxylase proteins**, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that **NK cell maturation states determine metastatic susceptibility**, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We recently showed that **aspirin prevents cancer metastasis** by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of aspirin's previously observed anti-metastatic activity. Building on this interest, we are **developing preventative immunotherapies**—including novel biologics and small molecules—to prevent cancer or its recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to improve outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.
