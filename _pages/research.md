I am trying to shape this text into an overview of our lab's research on T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer. Please reshape to describe our lab's work under three headings (no subheadings). Please bring the Treg biology in section "Immune Regulation and Autoimmunity" into the "Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression" as broader investigation into how Tregs develop and function, yielding some fundamental observations alongside cancer relevance. Finally add a component on T cell maintenance and dysfunction

1. Immune Regulation and Autoimmunity
Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical to immune homeostasis. My research elucidated how Treg cells develop and function. I discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is required for Treg development and established a widely accepted molecular model of BACH2 function (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Nature Immunology 2016). This resolved why genetic variations at the human BACH2 locus are associated with susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy. These findings led me to establish an international collaboration resulting in identification of a new human disease, BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), enabling improved management of affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). My group has since identified BACH2 functions in other lymphocyte lineages, including critical roles in memory CD8+ T cells and NK cell maturation (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022). We determined how non-coding genetic polymorphisms at the prominent 11q13.5 immune disease risk locus cause susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease, showing that a distal enhancer promotes Treg-mediated suppression of colitis through regulation of GARP (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020).
 
2. Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression
My laboratory revealed how the chemical environment of tumours presents barriers to immunity. We showed that tumor cell death releases intracellular potassium, suppressing T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016). We discovered that interleukin-2 is inactivated by tumor acidity, enabling engineering of pH-selective IL-2 muteins with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., *Science Immunology *2023). My group showed that activated Treg responses within tumours are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitors, raising fundamental questions about Treg organization that my ERC Consolidator Award addresses (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified that CCR8 marks both highly suppressive Treg cells and a suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells mediating immunotherapy resistance through IL-10-dependent mechanisms (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We developed methods to functionally reprogram Treg cells using OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies to produce IFN-γ, enhancing anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).
 
3. Immune Prevention of Cancer Metastasis
A new research direction focuses on preventing cancer metastasis through immune mechanisms. We demonstrated that oxygen sensing by T cells through prolyl hydroxylase proteins establishes an immunologically tolerant metastatic niche (Clever et al., *Cell *2016). We showed NK cell maturation states determine susceptibility to metastasis, with BACH2 restricting NK anti-metastatic function (Imianowski et al., *J Exp Med *2022). Most significantly, we discovered that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by limiting platelet TXA2-mediated suppression of T cell immunity, offering immediate clinical application for millions of cancer survivors (Yang et al., Nature 2025). These findings form part of our broader program developing preventative immunotherapies to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis, addressing the primary cause of cancer mortality.

Within tumors, our group showed that activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitors, raising fundamental questions about Treg organization that our ERC Consolidator Award addresses (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified that CCR8 marks both highly suppressive Treg cells and a suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells mediating immunotherapy resistance through IL-10-dependent mechanisms (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We developed methods to functionally reprogram Treg cells using OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies to produce IFN-γ, enhancing anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Our work on BACH2 extends beyond Treg biology to reveal critical functions in other lymphocyte lineages. We identified essential roles for BACH2 in memory CD8+ T cells and NK cell maturation (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022), demonstrating how this transcriptional program coordinates immune cell maintenance across multiple lineages. These findings illuminate how T cells sustain functional capacity and how disruption of these programs contributes to immune dysfunction in disease contexts.

Immune Prevention of Cancer Metastasis
A major research direction focuses on preventing cancer metastasis through immune mechanisms. We demonstrated that oxygen sensing by T cells through prolyl hydroxylase proteins establishes an immunologically tolerant metastatic niche (Clever et al., Cell 2016), and showed NK cell maturation states determine susceptibility to metastasis, with BACH2 restricting NK anti-metastatic function (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022). Most significantly, we discovered that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by limiting platelet TXA2-mediated suppression of T cell immunity, offering immediate clinical application for millions of cancer survivors (Yang et al., Nature 2025). These findings form part of our broader program developing preventative immunotherapies to prevent recurrence in early cancer patients at risk of metastasis, addressing the primary cause of cancer mortality.

For the T cell maintenance and dysfunction section, please use the following: T cell maintenance and dysfunction
T cell responses are clonally expanded from small numbers of antigen-specific naive precursor cells which arose during thymic development. Upon priming, antigen-specific T cell responses must be maintained over long periods of time to enable T cell memory and durable responses to chronic antigens. Our laboratory is interested in the mechanisms that underpin long-lived T cell responses (Figure 3).
We have made progress in understanding how T cell dysfunction is induced by the interstitial microenvironment of cancer. We showed that high interstitial potassium concentrations within tumours limits CD8+ T cell function through suppression of the AKT/mTOR pathway (Nature 2016). We have shown that Treg differentiation is sensitive to local oxygen concentration contributing to lung immune homeostasis but creating a permissive environment for pulmonary cancer metastasis (Cell 2016). This research has led to new therapeutic opportunities and formed the basis for a number of industrial collaborations including with AstraZeneca and CRUK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories.
We have a long-standing interest in T cell maintenance. We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells revealing unappreciated heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (PNAS 2011). We defined transcriptional and epigenetic programmes of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Vaccine 2015, Cell Mol Immunol 2015). We showed that the transcription factor BACH2 functions as a quiescence factor promoting maintenance of long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection are maintained (Nat Immunol 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 functions as a repressor of TCR-driven effector programmes by binding the genomic binding sites of AP-1 and sterically hindering access by AP-1 TFs. We showed that long-term maintenance of Treg populations is dependent upon the presence of a subset of functionally quiescent cells marked by high levels of Bach2 expression (J Exp Med 2020). We have also found that BACH2 functions as a quiescence factor in NK cells restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022). We have contributed to work showing that inhibition of AKT signalling enables expansion of T cells with a long-lived memory phenotype which mediates superior adoptive immunotherapy responses upon transfer into tumour-bearing recipients (Cancer Res, 2015), and that memory T cell–driven differentiation of naive cells impairs adoptive immunotherapy (J Clin Invest, 2015). Several projects in the laboratory now aim to exploit our understanding of T cell maintenance mechanisms to improve the long-term maintenance and function of T cells in the context of cell therapy, including CAR T cell and Treg cell therapy.

T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer T cells drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as immunoregulator

Thank you. I've edited slightly as attached. Can you now try to make this more fluent and like a website for a research lab, attractive to funders and potential recruits? We are moving towards bringing our research towards patient benefit through development of novel biologics and small molecule therapies to improve therapies for patients with advanced cancers, or to prevent cancer and its recurrence

T Cell Immunity and Immunosuppression in Cancer
T cells are essential drivers of immune responses that clear infections and eliminate cancer cells. However, the immune system employs sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to prevent excessive T cell activation that could lead to autoimmune and allergic diseases. These same immunoregulatory mechanisms—acting as 'brakes' on the immune system—are exploited by tumors to evade immune destruction. Understanding and targeting these mechanisms has revolutionized cancer treatment, as exemplified by the clinical success of checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4.

Our laboratory pursues fundamental discoveries in immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression to develop transformative therapies for patients. We combine mechanistic immunology with translational approaches, employing cutting-edge technologies including CRISPR-based functional genetics, directed tumor evolution, and rational therapeutic design. Our research increasingly focuses on translating mechanistic insights into novel biologics and small molecule therapies that can benefit patients with advanced cancers and prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression
Decoding tumor-immune interactions to unlock new therapeutic strategies

Tumors create hostile chemical and cellular environments that profoundly suppress anti-tumor immunity. Our laboratory has revealed fundamental mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses, opening new therapeutic avenues. We discovered that dying tumor cells release intracellular potassium that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2, enabling us to engineer pH-selective IL-2 variants with preferential activity in the acidic tumor environment (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to systematically identify novel immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells represent a major barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity. Our research program has made pioneering contributions to understanding how Treg cells develop and function, with direct implications for cancer immunotherapy. We discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development and established a widely accepted molecular model of BACH2 function (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Nature Immunology 2016). This work resolved why genetic variations at the human BACH2 locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to our identification—through international collaboration—of BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), a previously unrecognized human disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We further showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent 11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nature 2020).

Within tumors, we discovered that activated Treg responses are sustained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of Treg biology and forming the basis of our ERC Consolidator Award (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). Building on these insights, we are developing therapeutic strategies to reprogram Treg cells within tumors, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Engineering durable T cell responses for cancer immunotherapy

Effective immune responses to cancer require T cells to be maintained over extended periods while retaining functional capacity. Our laboratory has pioneered understanding of the molecular programs that govern T cell longevity and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now translating into improved cell therapies for cancer patients.

We have made seminal contributions to understanding T cell maintenance. Among the first to apply multiplexed single-cell gene expression analysis to immune cells, we revealed unexpected heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (PNAS 2011) and defined the transcriptional and epigenetic programs that characterize vaccine-induced memory T cells (Vaccine 2015; Cell Mol Immunol 2015). We discovered that BACH2 functions as a master regulator of cellular quiescence, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Nat Immunol 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs by occupying AP-1 binding sites and sterically blocking AP-1 transcription factor access. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains NK cell maturation, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

Our investigations into T cell dysfunction have illuminated how the tumor microenvironment biochemically disables T cells. We demonstrated that elevated interstitial potassium concentrations within tumors suppress CD8+ T cell function through inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway (Nature 2016), and that local oxygen tension regulates Treg differentiation—maintaining lung immune homeostasis but inadvertently creating a permissive niche for pulmonary metastasis (Cell 2016). These discoveries have generated therapeutic opportunities and catalyzed industrial partnerships with AstraZeneca and Cancer Research UK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories. We contributed to landmark studies showing that AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Cancer Res 2015), while also revealing that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (J Clin Invest 2015).

We are now leveraging these mechanistic insights to engineer improved CAR T cell and Treg cell therapies. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate therapeutically superior cell products with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function for patients with advanced cancers.

Cancer Prevention and Prevention of Metastasis
Harnessing immunity to prevent cancer before it spreads

Metastasis causes the vast majority of cancer deaths, yet few therapeutic strategies target metastatic dissemination. Our laboratory is pioneering immune-based approaches to prevent cancer metastasis—a paradigm shift toward intercepting cancer progression before it becomes incurable.

We have uncovered fundamental mechanisms by which future metastatic sites become immunologically permissive to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through prolyl hydroxylase proteins, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that NK cell maturation states critically determine metastatic susceptibility, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

Most significantly, we discovered that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which otherwise suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This finding offers an immediately translatable intervention for millions of cancer survivors at risk of recurrence. These advances anchor our expanding program to develop preventative immunotherapies—including novel biologics and small molecules—designed to prevent cancer onset or recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to fundamentally alter the trajectory of disease and transform outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.

We welcome inquiries from potential funders interested in supporting translational cancer immunology research and from talented scientists seeking to join our dynamic, collaborative team.

We contributed to studies showing that AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Cancer Res 2015), while also revealing that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (J Clin Invest 2015).

We are now leveraging these insights to engineer improved CAR T cell and Treg cell therapies. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function for patients with advanced cancers.

Cancer Prevention and Prevention of Metastasis
Harnessing immunity to prevent cancer before it spreads

Metastasis causes the vast majority of cancer deaths, yet few therapeutic strategies target metastatic dissemination. Our laboratory is developing immune-based approaches to prevent cancer metastasis, with the goal of intercepting cancer progression before it becomes incurable.

We have uncovered mechanisms by which future metastatic sites become immunologically permissive to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through prolyl hydroxylase proteins, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that NK cell maturation states critically determine metastatic susceptibility, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We recently discovered that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which otherwise suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This finding offers an immediately translatable intervention for millions of cancer survivors at risk of recurrence. Building on these findings, we are developing preventative immunotherapies—including novel biologics and small molecules—designed to prevent cancer onset or recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to improve outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.

We welcome inquiries from potential funders interested in supporting translational cancer immunology research and from talented scientists seeking to join our team.

THis is oversold - it adds to our understanding of the previously observed anti-metastatic activity of aspirin "This finding offers an immediately translatable intervention for millions of cancer survivors at risk of recurrence."

T Cell Immunity and Immunosuppression in Cancer
T cells are essential drivers of immune responses that clear infections and eliminate cancer cells. However, the immune system employs sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to prevent excessive T cell activation that could lead to autoimmune and allergic diseases. These same immunoregulatory mechanisms—acting as 'brakes' on the immune system—are exploited by tumors to evade immune destruction. Understanding and targeting these mechanisms has revolutionized cancer treatment, as exemplified by the clinical success of checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4.

Our laboratory pursues fundamental discoveries in immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression to develop transformative therapies for patients. We combine mechanistic immunology with translational approaches, employing cutting-edge technologies including CRISPR-based functional genetics, directed tumor evolution, and rational therapeutic design. Our research increasingly focuses on translating mechanistic insights into novel biologics and small molecule therapies that can benefit patients with advanced cancers and prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression
Decoding tumor-immune interactions to unlock new therapeutic strategies

Tumors create hostile chemical and cellular environments that profoundly suppress anti-tumor immunity. We have revealed fundamental mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells release intracellular potassium that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2, enabling us to engineer pH-selective IL-2 variants with preferential activity in the acidic tumor environment (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to systematically identify novel immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells represent a major barrier to effective anti-tumor immunity. Our work has contributed to understanding how Treg cells develop and function, with direct implications for cancer immunotherapy. We discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development and established a molecular model of BACH2 function (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Nature Immunology 2016). This work resolved why genetic variations at the human BACH2 locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), a previously unrecognized human disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent 11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nature 2020).

Within tumors, we discovered that activated Treg responses are sustained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of Treg organization and forming the basis of our ERC Consolidator Award (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). Building on these insights, we are developing therapeutic strategies to reprogram Treg cells within tumors, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Engineering durable T cell responses for cancer immunotherapy

Effective immune responses to cancer require T cells to be maintained over extended periods while retaining functional capacity. We have contributed to understanding the molecular programs that govern T cell longevity and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now translating into improved cell therapies for cancer patients.

We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells, revealing unexpected heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (PNAS 2011) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs that characterize vaccine-induced memory T cells (Vaccine 2015; Cell Mol Immunol 2015). We discovered that BACH2 functions as a master regulator of cellular quiescence, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Nat Immunol 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs by occupying AP-1 binding sites and sterically blocking AP-1 transcription factor access. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains NK cell maturation, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

Our work on T cell dysfunction has illuminated how the tumor microenvironment biochemically disables T cells. We demonstrated that elevated interstitial potassium concentrations within tumors suppress CD8+ T cell function through inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway (Nature 2016), and that local oxygen tension regulates Treg differentiation—maintaining lung immune homeostasis but inadvertently creating a permissive niche for pulmonary metastasis (Cell 2016).

You're right to question it. The opening is quite dense and uses a lot of technical jargon that might lose some readers. Here's a more accessible version:

T cells are powerful immune cells that eliminate infections and cancer. However, the immune system must carefully balance T cell activity—too much can cause autoimmune and allergic diseases, while too little allows infections and cancers to flourish. The immune system uses regulatory mechanisms that act as 'brakes' to prevent excessive immune responses. Tumors exploit these same brakes to evade immune destruction, but targeting them with checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 has transformed cancer treatment.

Our laboratory investigates how the immune system is regulated and how tumors suppress immunity. We aim to translate these fundamental discoveries into new therapies for patients with cancer.

please change the first paragraph of the metastasis prevention to present these ideas in very condensed form: Cancer metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer-related deaths, killing 10 million people globally in
2020. With advances in public awareness, diagnostics and screening, an increasing frequency of
individuals are diagnosed with early stage cancers which can be treated with curative intent.
However, many such individuals will develop metastatic recurrence months to years later, resulting
from the eventual growth of early/dormant micrometastases1
. There remains a critical gap in our
therapeutic armamentarium - we lack dedicated anti-metastatic agents to prevent recurrence in
patients treated with early stage cancers who are at risk of metastasis.
The early stages of metastatic colonisation represent a critical window during which cancer cells are
uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, being deprived of the highly immunosuppressive
microenvironment found within established tumours2,3
. We also now know that newly metastasised
cells and dormant metastases are susceptible to distinct modes of immunity compared to
established primary or secondary tumours. The current focus of immunotherapy development is T
cell centric but our findings show that innate immune cells (notably NK cells, T cells, neutrophils
and macrophages) play a critical role in constraint of metastasis4-15
. Moreover, the spectrum of T cell
functions relevant for anti-metastatic immunity are distinct from those which mediate antitumour
effects in established tumours. The aim of this CoRE is to develop dedicated anti-metastatic
adjuvant/neo-adjuvant immunotherapies which intercept early/dormant metastatic lesions and
destroy them before their progression into established, treatment-resistant tumours. This will
extend the scope and impact of immunotherapy from the advanced cancer context to prevent
recurrence in patients with early-stage cancers at risk of metastasis.

We demonstrated that elevated potassium concentrations within tumors suppress CD8+ T cell function through inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway (Eil et al., Nature 2016), and that local oxygen levels regulate Treg differentiation—maintaining lung immune homeostasis but creating a permissive environment for pulmonary metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). These discoveries have led to therapeutic opportunities and industrial partnerships with AstraZeneca and Cancer Research UK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories. We contributed to studies showing that AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015), and that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (Gattinoni et al., J Clin Invest 2015).

We are now using these insights to engineer improved CAR T cell and Treg cell therapies. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function for patients with advanced cancers.

Cancer Prevention and Prevention of Metastasis
Using immunity to prevent cancer from spreading

Metastasis accounts for 90% of cancer deaths. While advances in screening enable early cancer detection and treatment with curative intent, many patients develop metastatic recurrence from dormant micrometastases that evaded initial therapy. There is a critical gap in our therapeutic arsenal—we lack dedicated agents to prevent metastasis in high-risk patients. The early stages of metastatic colonization represent a unique window when cancer cells are vulnerable to immune attack, being outside the highly immunosuppressive environment of established tumors. Newly metastasized and dormant cancer cells are susceptible to distinct modes of immunity compared to established tumors, particularly innate immune cells including NK cells, γδ T cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. We aim to develop preventative immunotherapies that intercept early metastatic lesions before their progression into treatment-resistant tumors.

We have identified mechanisms by which future metastatic sites become immunologically permissive to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through prolyl hydroxylase proteins, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that NK cell maturation states determine metastatic susceptibility, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We recently discovered that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of aspirin's previously observed anti-metastatic activity. Building on these findings, we are developing preventative immunotherapies—including novel biologics and small molecules—to prevent cancer or its recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to improve outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.

We welcome inquiries from potential funders interested in supporting translational cancer immunology research and from talented scientists seeking to join our team.

Actually use this intro: Despite advances in primary cancer treatment, many patients treated for early-stage cancers develop metastatic recurrence months to years later owing to the eventual growth of disseminated micrometastases4. Micrometastases are vulnerable to immune attack, as they are deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours3. This creates an opportunity for anti-metastatic therapies that utilize the immune system to prevent recurrence in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

T Cell Immunity and Immunosuppression in Cancer
The immune system has a powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells, but its function is often suppressed within tumors, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, most patients still do not respond to current immunotherapies and die from their disease.

Our laboratory investigates the mechanisms that regulate immune responses and how tumors exploit these to evade destruction. We aim to translate fundamental discoveries into new therapies for patients with cancer. We combine mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research increasingly focuses on developing novel biologics and small molecule therapies to improve treatment for patients with advanced cancers and prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression
Understanding how tumors disable immune responses

Tumors create hostile chemical and cellular environments that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We have identified mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells release intracellular potassium that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2, enabling us to engineer pH-selective IL-2 variants with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing new biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells represent a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity. We have studied how Treg cells develop and function, with direct implications for cancer immunotherapy. We discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development and established a molecular model of BACH2 function (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). This work explained why genetic variations at the human BACH2 locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), a previously unrecognized human disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent 11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020).

Within tumors, we discovered that activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells, changing our understanding of how Treg populations are organized and forming the basis of our ERC Consolidator Award (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now developing therapeutic strategies to reprogram Treg cells within tumors, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Engineering durable T cell responses for cancer immunotherapy

Effective immune responses to cancer require T cells to persist over long periods while retaining their ability to kill tumor cells. We have studied the molecular programs that control T cell longevity and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now translating into improved cell therapies for cancer patients.

We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells, revealing heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (Shalek et al., PNAS 2011) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Nakaya et al., Vaccine 2015; Kazmin et al., Cell Mol Immunol 2015). We discovered that BACH2 functions as a regulator of cellular quiescence, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs by occupying AP-1 binding sites and blocking access by AP-1 transcription factors. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains NK cell maturation, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

I'm hoping to introduce the last section as also being interested in early cancer prevention as well as metastasis prevention. Here's an argument we could use: Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment which limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Yet cancers both at their earliest pre-cancer stage and at the newly established/dormant micrometastasis stage are deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours. This creates an opportunity for therapies that utilize the immune system to prevent cancer in high risk individuals or prevent recurrence in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

The immune system has a powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells, but its function is often suppressed within tumors, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, most patients still do not respond to today's immunotherapies.
Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses and resist immunotherapies to evade destruction. We aim to translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies for patients with cancer. We combine mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel biologic, cellular and small molecule therapies to improve treatment of advanced cancer patients or to prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.
### Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression
#### Understanding how tumors disable immune responses
Tumors create hostile chemical and cellular environments that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We are interested in identifying and targeting mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells release intracellular potassium that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2, enabling us to engineer pH-selective IL-2 variants with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.
Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress conventional T cell responses and are a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity (Figure 1). We are interested in understanding how Treg cells develop and function. We discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development and established a widely-accepted molecular model for BACH2 function in lymphocytes (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). This work explained why genetic variations at the human BACH2 locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), a previously unrecognised human monogenic disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent 11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020).

Within tumors, we discovered that activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells, raising questions about how Treg populations are maintained within tumours (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now examining how therapeutic strategies could reprogram Treg cells within tumors, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).
### T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
#### Enhancing T cell maintenance and function to improve cancer immunotherapy
Effective immune responses to cancer require T cells to persist over long periods while retaining their ability to kill tumor cells. We have studied the molecular programs that control T cell longevity and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now aim to translate into improved cell therapies for cancer patients (Figure 2).

We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells, revealing heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (Flatz, Roychoudhuri et al., PNAS 2011) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Roychoudhuri et al., Vaccine 2015). We discovered that BACH2 functions as a regulator of T cell quiescence, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs by occupying AP-1 binding sites and blocking access by AP-1 transcription factors. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains NK cell maturation, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022). 
We contributed to studies showing that AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015), and that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (Gattinoni et al., J Clin Invest 2015).
We are now using these insights to engineer improved CAR T cell therapies. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function for patients with advanced cancers.
### Immune Interception of Cancer and Cancer Metastasis
#### Using immunity to prevent early cancer and its recurrence 
Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Yet cancers both at their earliest pre-malignant stage and at the newly established or dormant micrometastasis stage are deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours (Fig. 3). This creates an opportunity for therapies that utilize the immune system to prevent cancer in high-risk individuals or prevent recurrence in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

<figcaption>**Figure 1. The cancer immunoediting hypothesis and the window for immune-based prevention.** Cancer progression through elimination, equilibrium, and escape phases results in the establishment of a protective immunosuppressive microenvironment, featuring regulatory T cells, MDSCs, TAMs, and suppressive factors that shield advanced tumours from immune attack. However, early-stage cancers and disseminated micrometastases lack this immunosuppressive armor, remaining vulnerable to elimination by T cells and NK cells. The immune vulnerability curve (bottom) reveals two critical therapeutic windows: early cancers before escape mechanisms develop, and micrometastatic deposits that are deprived of the protective tumour microenvironment. This vulnerability of early and disseminated disease represents a major opportunity for preventive immunotherapy—targeting cancer when it is most susceptible to immune elimination rather than after immunosuppressive defenses are established.

We are interested in identifying mechanisms by which metastatic sites become immunologically permissive to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through prolyl hydroxylase proteins, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that NK cell maturation states determine metastatic susceptibility, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).
We recently showed that aspirin prevents cancer metastasis by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of aspirin's previously observed anti-metastatic activity. Building on this interest, we are developing preventative immunotherapies—including novel biologics and small molecules—to prevent cancer or its recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to improve outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.

The immune system has a powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells, but its function is often suppressed within tumors, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, most patients still do not respond to today's immunotherapies.

Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses and resist immunotherapies to evade destruction. We aim to translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies for patients with cancer. We combine mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel biologic, cellular and small molecule therapies to improve treatment of advanced cancer patients or to prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

### Tumor Microenvironment and Cancer Immunosuppression

#### Understanding how tumors disable immune responses

Tumors create hostile chemical and cellular environments that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We are interested in identifying and targeting mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells release intracellular potassium that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2, enabling us to engineer pH-selective IL-2 variants with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress conventional T cell responses and are a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity (Figure 1). We are interested in understanding how Treg cells develop and function. We discovered that the transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development and established a widely-accepted molecular model for BACH2 function in lymphocytes (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016).

Are there any problems with this code? The text keeps getting narrower after each figure caption:

The issue is with your figure styling. The <div style="text-align:left"> wrapper is causing each subsequent figure to inherit and compound text alignment properties. Here's the problem:

html
<div style="text-align:left">
<figure style="min-width: 350px; display: inline-block; float:none; vertical-align: top; clear: both;">
The text-align:left on the wrapping div combined with display: inline-block on the figure creates a narrowing effect as inline-block elements respect text-align properties of their container.

Fix: Remove the wrapper divs and apply all styling directly to the figure element:

Here;s the updated code. The figure legends come out on the browser like follows: Figure 2. Maintenance of acute and chronic T cell responses. In both acute and chronic immune responses, T cells undergo progressive differentiation accompanied by acquisition of effector functions and loss of maintenance potential self-renewal and multipotency. This loss of maintenance potential is a key feature of the progression of T cells from naive, effector, and memory T cell subsets in acute responses, as well as progenitor, intermediate, and terminally exhausted T cells in chronic responses.</figcaption> </figure> </div>

The issue is that your Markdown bold syntax (**text**) inside HTML <figcaption> tags isn't being processed. The closing </figcaption> and </figure> tags are appearing in the rendered output because the Markdown processor is treating everything as literal text once it's inside HTML tags.

Solution: Use HTML <strong> tags instead of Markdown bold syntax inside your HTML elements:

html
<figure style="min-width: 350px; display: block; margin: 1em 0; clear: both;">

</figure>
Apply this change to all three figure captions:

Replace **Figure X. Title.** with <strong>Figure X. Title.</strong> in all <figcaption> tags
Also change display: inline-block to display: block in all figures (as I mentioned before) to prevent the narrowing issue
This will ensure your captions render properly with bold figure titles and the closing tags won't appear in the browser.

Key changes for all three figures:

display: inline-block → display: block
Remove float:none and vertical-align: top (not needed for block display)
Add margin: 1em auto (centers the figure and adds spacing)
The inline-block display makes figures behave like inline text elements, which causes them to respect text-alignment properties in unexpected ways and creates the narrowing effect. Block display treats them as standalone elements that won't have this issue.

Make this change to all three <figure> tags in your document.

The issue is that your Markdown image syntax inside HTML <figure> tags isn't being processed correctly by Jekyll. When you mix Markdown and HTML like this, the Markdown processor often skips the Markdown syntax inside HTML blocks.

Solution: Convert everything to pure HTML:

html
<figure style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 1.5em auto; clear: both;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/treg_development.png" alt="Immunoregulatory function within the T cell lineage" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

</figure>
Apply this pattern to all three figures. The key changes:

Replace ![alt text](url) with <img src="url" alt="alt text" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
Use display: block not inline-block
Add max-width: 800px to prevent figures from getting too large
Add margin: 1.5em auto for proper spacing and centering
The image itself gets width: 100% so it fills the figure container
This ensures consistent rendering across all figures without the narrowing problem.

<h3 style="margin-top:0px">T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer</h3> 
The immune system has a **powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells**, but its function is often **suppressed within tumors**, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including **checkpoint inhibitors** targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, **most patients still do not respond** to today's immunotherapies.

Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses to evade destruction and resist immunotherapy. We aim to **translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies** for patients with cancer. We combine mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel **biologic, cellular and small molecule therapies** to improve treatment of advanced cancer patients or to prevent cancer recurrence in those at high risk of metastasis.

### Suppression of T cell immunity within tumours
Tumors create **hostile chemical and cellular environments** that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We are interested in identifying and targeting mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells **release intracellular potassium** that suppresses T cell activation (Eil et al., Nature 2016) and that **tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2**, enabling us to engineer **pH-selective IL-2 variant** with preferential activity in acidic tumors (Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

**Regulatory T (Treg) cells** suppress conventional T cell responses and are a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity (**Figure 1**). We are interested in understanding how Treg cells develop and function. We discovered that the **transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development** and established a widely-accepted molecular model for BACH2 function in lymphocytes (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013; Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). This work explained why genetic variations at the human *BACH2* locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of **BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA)**, a previously unrecognised human monogenic disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide (Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent **11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus** restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020).

</figure>

Within tumors, we discovered that **activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells**, raising questions about how Treg populations are maintained within tumours (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We identified **CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells** and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production (Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023). We are now examining how therapeutic strategies could **reprogram Treg cells within tumors**, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).

### T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Effective immune responses to cancer require **T cells to persist over long periods** while retaining their ability to kill tumor cells. We have studied the **molecular programs that control T cell longevity** and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now aim to translate into improved cell therapies for cancer patients (**Figure 2**).

<figcaption><strong>Figure 2. Maintenance of acute and chronic T cell responses.</strong> In both acute and chronic immune responses, T cells undergo progressive differentiation accompanied by acquisition of effector functions and loss of maintenance potential self-renewal and multipotency. This loss of maintenance potential is a key feature of the progression of T cells from naive, effector, and memory T cell subsets in acute responses, as well as progenitor, intermediate, and terminally exhausted T cells in chronic responses.</figcaption>
</figure>

We conducted one of the earliest **multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses** of immune cells, revealing heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination (Flatz, Roychoudhuri et al., PNAS 2011) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of vaccine-induced memory T cells (Roychoudhuri et al., Vaccine 2015). We discovered that **BACH2 functions as a regulator of T cell quiescence**, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016). Mechanistically, **BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs** by occupying AP-1 binding sites and blocking access by AP-1 transcription factors. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020), and that BACH2 similarly constrains **NK cell maturation**, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We contributed to studies showing that **AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics** and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy (Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015), and that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy (Gattinoni et al., J Clin Invest 2015).

We are now using these insights to engineer **improved CAR T cell therapies**. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with **enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function** for patients with advanced cancers.

### Immune Interception of Early Cancer and Cancer Metastasis
Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Yet early pre-malignant cancers and newly established or dormant micrometastases lack the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours (Fig. 3). This creates an opportunity for therapies that **utilize the immune system to prevent cancer** in high-risk individuals or **prevent recurrence** in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

<figure style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 1.5em auto; clear: both;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/cancer_development_metastasis.png" alt="The cancer immunoediting hypothesis and the window for immune-based prevention" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 3. Immune vulnerability of cancer cells at distinct stages of cancer development provides a potential window for immune prevention.</strong> Cancer progression through elimination, equilibrium, and escape phases results in the establishment of a protective immunosuppressive microenvironment, featuring regulatory T cells, MDSCs, TAMs, and suppressive factors that shield advanced tumours from immune attack. However, early-stage cancers and disseminated micrometastases lack this immunosuppressive armor, remaining vulnerable to elimination by T cells and NK cells. The immune vulnerability curve (bottom) reveals two critical therapeutic windows: early cancers before escape mechanisms develop, and micrometastatic deposits that are deprived of the protective tumour microenvironment. This vulnerability of early and disseminated disease represents a major opportunity for preventive immunotherapy—targeting cancer when it is most susceptible to immune elimination rather than after immunosuppressive defenses are established.</figcaption>
</figure>

We are interested in identifying mechanisms by which **metastatic sites become immunologically permissive** to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through **prolyl hydroxylase proteins**, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). We demonstrated that **NK cell maturation states determine metastatic susceptibility**, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022).

We recently showed that **aspirin prevents cancer metastasis** by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which suppresses T cell immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of aspirin's previously observed anti-metastatic activity. Building on this interest, we are **developing preventative immunotherapies**—including novel biologics and small molecules—to prevent cancer or its recurrence in high-risk patients. By targeting cancer before widespread metastatic dissemination occurs, we aim to improve outcomes for patients facing the greatest cancer burden.

This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression ([Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515782)), and that BACH2 similarly constrains **NK cell maturation**, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis ([Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36178457)). We contributed to studies showing that **AKT pathway inhibition generates T cells with enhanced memory characteristics** and superior anti-tumor activity in adoptive cell therapy ([Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25432172)), and that memory T cell-driven differentiation can impair therapeutic efficacy ([Gattinoni et al., J Clin Invest 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657860)).

We are now using these insights to engineer **improved CAR T cell therapies**. Multiple ongoing projects aim to harness T cell maintenance programs to generate cell products with **enhanced persistence and anti-tumor function** for patients with advanced cancers.

### Immune Interception of Early Cancer and Cancer Metastasis
Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment that limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Yet early pre-malignant cancers and newly established or dormant micrometastases lack the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumours (Fig. 3). This creates an opportunity for therapies that **utilize the immune system to prevent cancer** in high-risk individuals or **prevent recurrence** in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis.

Immune vulnerability of cancer cells at distinct stages of cancer development provides a potential window for immune prevention.</strong> Cancer progression through elimination, equilibrium, and escape phases results in the establishment of a protective immunosuppressive microenvironment, featuring regulatory T cells, MDSCs, TAMs, and suppressive factors that shield advanced tumours from immune attack.

The immune vulnerability curve (bottom) reveals two critical therapeutic windows: early cancers before escape mechanisms develop, and micrometastatic deposits that are deprived of the protective tumour microenvironment. This vulnerability of early and disseminated disease represents a major opportunity for preventive immunotherapy—targeting cancer when it is most susceptible to immune elimination rather than after immunosuppressive defenses are established.</p>

We are interested in identifying mechanisms by which **metastatic sites become immunologically permissive** to tumor cell seeding. We showed that T cells sense high oxygen concentrations in lung tissue through **prolyl hydroxylase proteins**, establishing an immunologically tolerant niche vulnerable to metastasis ([Clever et al., Cell 2016](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27565342)). We demonstrated that **NK cell maturation states determine metastatic susceptibility**, with BACH2 limiting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases ([Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36178457)).

We recently showed that **aspirin prevents cancer metastasis** by blocking platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which suppresses T cell immunity ([Yang et al., Nature 2025](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40044852)). This work provides a mechanistic understanding of aspirin's previously observed anti-metastatic activity. Building on this interest, we are **developing preventative immunotherapies**—including novel biologics and small molecules—to prevent cancer or its recurrence in high-risk patients.

<h3 style="margin-top:0px">T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer</h3> 
The immune system has a **powerful ability to recognize and kill cancer cells**, but its function is often **suppressed within tumours**, preventing clearance of disease. Understanding how tumors suppress immunity has led to major therapeutic advances, including checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. However, **most patients do not durably respond** to today's immunotherapies.

Our laboratory aims to discover how cancers suppress T cell responses to evade destruction and resist immunotherapy. We aim to **translate fundamental discoveries into new more effective therapies** for patients with cancer, combining mechanistic immunology with cutting-edge approaches including CRISPR-based functional genetics and directed tumor evolution. Our research is increasingly focused on developing novel biologic, cellular and molecular therapies to **improve treatment** of advanced cancer patients or to **prevent cancer recurrence** in those at high risk of metastasis.

### Suppression of T cell immunity within tumours
Tumors create **hostile chemical and cellular environments** that suppress anti-tumor immunity. We are interested in identifying and targeting mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment disables T cell responses. We discovered that dying tumor cells **release intracellular potassium** that suppresses T cell activation ([Eil et al., Nature 2016](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/27626381.pdf)) and that **tumor acidity inactivates interleukin-2**, enabling us to engineer **pH-selective IL-2 variant** with preferential activity in acidic tumors ([Gaggero et al., Science Immunology 2022](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/36459543.pdf)). We are now applying directed tumor evolution and high-throughput CRISPR screens to identify additional immunoregulatory mechanisms within tumors, with the goal of developing next-generation biological and small molecule approaches to enhance T cell function.

**Regulatory T (Treg) cells** suppress conventional T cell responses and are a major barrier to anti-tumor immunity (**Figure 1**). We are interested in understanding how Treg cells develop and function. We discovered that the **transcriptional repressor BACH2 is essential for Treg cell development** and established a widely-accepted molecular model for BACH2 function in lymphocytes ([Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/23728300.pdf); [Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/27158840.pdf)). This work explained why genetic variations at the human *BACH2* locus confer susceptibility to autoimmunity and allergy, and led to identification—through international collaboration—of **BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA)**, a previously unrecognised human monogenic disease, improving clinical management for affected patients worldwide ([Afzali et al., Nature Immunology 2017](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/28530713.pdf)). We showed how a distal enhancer at the prominent **11q13.5 autoimmune disease risk locus** restricts gut inflammation by promoting expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Treg cells ([Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/32499651.pdf)).

<p style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 1.5em auto; font-style: italic;"><strong>Figure 1. Regulatory T cell development.</strong> CD4+ effector and regulatory T (Treg) cells arise from common precursor cells within the thymus and periphery by exert opposing functions. Treg-mediated restraint of effector cell function is a critical immunoregulatory mechanism required to prevent lethal inflammation. Modified from Igarashi, Kurosaki and Roychoudhuri, Nat Rev Immunol 2017.</p>

Within tumors, we discovered that **activated Treg responses are maintained by quiescent stem-like progenitor cells**, raising questions about how Treg populations are maintained within tumours ([Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/32515782.pdf)). We identified **CCR8 as a marker of highly suppressive tumor-infiltrating Treg cells** and a distinct suppressive subset of conventional CD4+ T cells that mediate immunotherapy resistance through IL-10 production ([Whiteside et al., Science Immunology 2023](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/38100544.pdf)). We are now examining how therapeutic strategies could **reprogram Treg cells within tumors**, including OX40/CD137 bispecific antibodies that convert Tregs into IFN-γ-producing cells that enhance anti-tumor immunity ([Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/38995700.pdf)).

### T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Effective immune responses to cancer require **T cells to persist over long periods** while retaining their ability to kill tumor cells. We have studied the **molecular programs that control T cell longevity** and how tumors induce T cell dysfunction—insights we are now aim to translate into improved cell therapies for cancer patients (**Figure 2**).

<p style="width: 90%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 1.5em auto; font-style: italic;"><strong>Figure 2. Maintenance of acute and chronic T cell responses.</strong> In both acute and chronic immune responses, T cells undergo progressive differentiation accompanied by acquisition of effector functions and loss of maintenance potential self-renewal and multipotency. This loss of maintenance potential is a key feature of the progression of T cells from naive, effector, and memory T cell subsets in acute responses, as well as progenitor, intermediate, and terminally exhausted T cells in chronic responses.</p>

We conducted one of the earliest multiplexed single-cell gene expression analyses of immune cells, revealing heterogeneity in memory CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination ([Flatz, Roychoudhuri et al., PNAS 2011](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/21422297.pdf)) and defining the transcriptional and epigenetic programs of vaccine-induced memory T cells ([Roychoudhuri et al., Vaccine 2015](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/25446821.pdf)). We discovered that **BACH2 functions as a regulator of T cell quiescence**, promoting long-lived memory CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection ([Roychoudhuri et al., Nature Immunology 2016](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/27158840.pdf)). Mechanistically, **BACH2 represses T cell receptor-driven effector programs** by occupying AP-1 binding sites and blocking access by AP-1 transcription factors. This quiescence program extends beyond CD8+ T cells: we showed that long-term Treg cell maintenance depends on a quiescent subset marked by high Bach2 expression ([Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/32515782.pdf)), and that BACH2 similarly constrains **NK cell maturation**, restricting NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastasis ([Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022](https://roychoudhurilab.org/media/fulltext/36178457.pdf)).
