<h3 style="margin-top:0px">T cell immunity and immunosuppression in cancer</h3> 
**T cells** drive immune activation and promote clearance of infections and cancer. However, their function can provoke autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The immune system therefore employs a variety of suppressive mechanisms, known as **immunoregulatory mechanisms**, to restrain excessive T cell activation and prevent autoimmune and allergic inflammation. It is now known that such suppressive mechanisms inhibit anti-tumour immunity to drive deleterious **immunosuppression** in cancer. Immunoregulatory mechanisms therefore function as ‘brakes’ within the immune system and are important therapeutic targets in cancer. This is exemplified by the clinical efficacy of cancer immunotherapies targeting the immune ‘checkpoints’ PD-1 and CTLA-4 in certain cancers. 

We believe that fundamental discovery in the fields of immune regulation and cancer immunosuppression will enable development of new and more effective therapies for patients with presently incurable autoimmune and allergic diseases and cancer. Our research falls within three key areas described below.

### Suppression of T cell immunity in cancer
Cancers evolve sophisticated mechanisms to suppress T cell immunity. We are using cutting-edge in vivo models, directed tumour evolution and CRISPR-based functional genetics to discover how tumours orchestrate immune dysfunction and identify therapeutic vulnerabilities.

#### Regulatory T (Treg) cell development and maintenance
Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critical role in cancer immunosuppression. We identified the transcription factor BACH2 as essential for Treg development (Roychoudhuri et al., Nature 2013), explaining why BACH2 variants predispose to autoimmune and allergic diseases. We showed that in developing Treg precursors, BACH2 enforces Treg identity by repressing alternative lineage programmes. We showed that BACH2 promotes cancer immunosuppression (Roychoudhuri et al., J Clin Invest 2015). Working with an international group of clinicians and scientists, these discoveries led to discovery of a new human disease, called BACH2-related Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity (BRIDA), enabled improved patient diagnosis and treatment (Afzali et al., Nat Immunol 2017). We found that the function of BACH2 is repurposed in lineage-committed Treg cells, wherein it acts as a quiescence factor paradoxically required to maintain highly activated tumour-infiltrating Treg populations (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). We have subsequently developed cell-based reporter assays for BACH2 function (Vardaka et al., Scientific Reports 2020), enabling a drug discovery programme in collaboration with Cancer Research UK Therapeutic Discovery Laboratories.

#### Targetting Treg suppression within tumours
 We showed that the chemokine receptor CCR8 marks highly suppressive Tregs within tumours, but showed that CCR8 is dispensable for Treg migration and function within tumours, informing therapeutic targeting strategies (Whiteside et al., Immunology 2021). We found that upon Treg depletion, conventional CD4+ T cells marked by CCR8 expression acquire compensatory suppressive functions through IL-10 production, limiting efficacy of Treg-targeting therapies (Whiteside et al., Sci Immunol 2023). We showed that the chromosome 11q13.5 autoimmune risk locus drives expression of the TGF-β docking receptor GARP on Tregs, restricting inflammation (Nasrallah et al., Nature 2020). With F-Star Therapeutics, we showed that OX40/CD137 bispecific agonists can reprogram Tregs to produce IFN-γ and contribute to anti-tumour immunity (Imianowski et al., Cancer Res Commun 2024).
 
#### Immunosuppressive functions of the tumour interstitium 
We discovered that dying tumour cells release intracellular potassium, creating high extracellular potassium concentrations that profoundly suppress T cell activation via inhibition of TCR-driven AKT/mTOR signalling (Eil et al., Nature 2016). Engineering T cells to express the potassium efflux channel Kv1.3 restores anti-tumour function in adoptive immunotherapy. This discovery revealed how the tumour's ionic environment creates a hostile milieu for T cell function and opened new therapeutic avenues through metabolic and ionic reprogramming.

### Immune Prevention of Cancer and Metastasis
Advanced cancers are protected by a well-established immunosuppressive microenvironment which limits the efficacy of current immunotherapies. By understanding how the immune system interacts with early cancers and newly established/dormant micrometastases, we hope to extend the scope and efficacy of immunotherapy to either prevent cancer or metastatic recurrence.

<figcaption><b>Figure 2. The cancer immunoediting hypothesis and the window for immune-based prevention. Cancer progression through elimination, equilibrium, and escape phases results in the establishment of a protective immunosuppressive microenvironment, featuring regulatory T cells, MDSCs, TAMs, and suppressive factors that shield advanced tumours from immune attack. However, early-stage cancers and disseminated micrometastases lack this immunosuppressive armor, remaining vulnerable to elimination by T cells and NK cells. The immune vulnerability curve (bottom) reveals two critical therapeutic windows: early cancers before escape mechanisms develop, and micrometastatic deposits that are deprived of the protective tumour microenvironment. This vulnerability of early and disseminated disease represents a major opportunity for preventive immunotherapy—targeting cancer when it is most susceptible to immune elimination rather than after immunosuppressive defenses are established.

#### Aspirin prevents metastasis by releasing T cells from platelet suppression. 
 Despite advances in primary cancer treatment, many patients treated for early-stage cancers develop metastatic recurrence months to years later owing to the eventual growth of disseminated micrometastases. Micrometastases are vulnerable to immune attack, as they are deprived of the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours. This creates an opportunity for anti-metastatic therapies that utilize the immune system to prevent recurrence in patients with early-stage cancer at risk of metastasis. We recently found that platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2) suppresses T cells through the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, inhibiting TCR signalling and effector functions and limiting anti-metastatic immunity (Yang et al., Nature 2025). Aspirin blocks TXA2 production, releasing T cells from suppression and enabling immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. T cell-specific deletion of Arhgef1 increases metastatic site T cell activation and metastasis rejection. This mechanism underpins our collaboration with the ADD-ASPIRIN trial evaluating aspirin's anti-metastatic activity in cancer patients.

#### NK cell maturation determines anti-metastatic immunity. 
We discovered that tissue NK cell maturation state is critical for metastatic immunosurveillance. BACH2 functions as a quiescence factor restricting NK maturation, and its expression paradoxically limits NK-mediated immunosurveillance of lung metastases (Imianowski et al., J Exp Med 2022). This reveals why metastatic sites differ immunologically from established tumours and suggests approaches to augment anti-metastatic immunity.

#### Tissue-specific regulation of metastatic immunity. 
The unique microenvironments of metastatic sites shape immune responses differently than primary tumours. We showed that tissue oxygen levels regulate T cell differentiation, with the high oxygen environment in lungs promoting Treg differentiation and creating a permissive niche for pulmonary metastasis (Clever et al., Cell 2016). Understanding these tissue-specific mechanisms enables targeted approaches to prevent organ-specific metastasis.

### T Cell Maintenance and Dysfunction
Long-lived T cell responses are essential for protective immunity and effective immunotherapy. We investigate mechanisms governing T cell memory formation and dysfunction to enhance therapeutic responses.

<figcaption><b>Figure 3. Maintenance of acute and chronic T cell responses.</b> In both acute and chronic immune responses, T cells undergo progressive differentiation accompanied by acquisition of effector functions and loss of maintenance potential self-renewal and multipotency. This loss of maintenance potential is a key feature of the progression of T cells from naive, effector, and memory T cell subsets in acute responses, as well as progenitor, intermediate, and terminally exhausted T cells in chronic responses.

#### BACH2 orchestrates T cell memory 
We demonstrated that BACH2 is the master regulator of memory CD8+ T cell differentiation, restraining effector programmes after primary antigen exposure (Roychoudhuri et al., Nat Immunol 2016). Mechanistically, BACH2 engages in steric competition with AP-1 transcription factors at enhancers, preventing premature TCR-driven effector differentiation. This discovery has direct therapeutic applications—we have filed patents showing that controlled BACH2 expression in CAR T cells enhances their persistence and anti-tumour efficacy.

#### Quiescence and T cell maintenance
Our early multiplexed single-cell analyses revealed heterogeneity in memory T cell responses to vaccination (Flatz et al., PNAS 2011), leading to identification of transcriptional and epigenetic programmes governing vaccine-induced memory (Hertoghs et al., Vaccine 2015; Crompton et al., Cell Mol Immunol 2015). We showed that BACH2-driven quiescence is required for long-term maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells (Roychoudhuri et al., Nat Immunol 2016) and Treg populations (Grant et al., J Exp Med 2020). Inhibition of AKT signalling promotes T cells with enhanced memory phenotype and superior adoptive immunotherapy responses (Crompton et al., Cancer Res 2015).

#### Overcoming T cell dysfunction
Building on our mechanistic understanding, we develop strategies to prevent or reverse T cell dysfunction in cancer. We created cell-based reporter assays for BACH2 function (Vardaka et al., Scientific Reports 2020), enabling a drug discovery programme with Cancer Research Horizons to identify compounds that disrupt immunosuppression while preserving memory formation. Our work on ionic and metabolic suppression has revealed targetable vulnerabilities—from potassium channels to metabolic pathways—that can restore T cell function in hostile tumour environments.

Our research integrates cutting-edge technologies with fundamental immunology to translate mechanistic discoveries into transformative therapies. By understanding how tumours suppress immunity, how metastases evade immune surveillance, and how T cells maintain long-term function, we aim to develop more effective treatments for cancer and inflammatory diseases.
